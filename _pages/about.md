I am currently a **Post-Doc** researcher at EPFL in the [ECEO](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/eceo/fr/home-fr/) team under the supervision of [Devis Tuia](https://people.epfl.ch/devis.tuia).
I completed my **PhD** at Inria Saclay in the [Mind](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) team under the supervision of [Rémi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com/) and [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/).

My research interests include **machine learning**, **domain adaptation**, **optimal transport** and their applications to **time series** and **remote sensing**.

I am also interested in **open science** and **reproducible research**. I am the co-creator and maintainer of [Skada](https://github.com/scikit-adaptation/skada), a Python library for domain adaptation.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
