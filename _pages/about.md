I am currently a **PhD** student at Inria Saclay in the [Mind](https://team.inria.fr/mind/) team under the supervision of [RÃ©mi Flamary](https://remi.flamary.com/) and [Alexandre Gramfort](https://alexandre.gramfort.net/).

My research interests include **machine learning**, **domain adaptation**, **optimal transport** and their applications to **biosignals**. 

I am also interested in **open science** and **reproducible research**. I am the co-creator  and maintainer of [Skada](https://github.com/scikit-adaptation/skada), a Python library for domain adaptation.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](assets/pdfCV.pdf).
